# Exercices Haskell

## Introduction

This repository contains Haskell exercises made as part of my training course at school ETNA Paris (École des Technologies Numériques Avancées).

## Goals

* Understand functional programming in a simple way and understand its challenges
* Apply functional principles in Haskell

## Content

- `MyPool.hs`: This file contains all the functions implemented for the exercises.
- `individual/`: This folder contains each individual exercise, with its statement and solution implemented separately.

## Setup

For the installation of Haskell on your local machine I advise you to follow the [official website of Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository on your local machine :
    `git clone https://github.com/0Blanck0/Haskell-Exos`

2. To perform the functions contained in MyPool.hs, you can import this module into your own Haskell code :
    `import MyPool`

3. To access an individual exercise, navigate to the `individual/` corresponding to the exercise you are interested in.

## Warning

These exercises are intended for educational purposes and may contain imperfections.
